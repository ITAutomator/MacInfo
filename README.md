# Mac Info
Tells you a bunch of information about your mac device

Download the comp_info.sh file [here](https://github.com/ITAutomator/mac_info/blob/main/comp_info.sh). <br>
Save the file anywhere you would like but somewhere easy to access. <br>
Open the terminal on your device ___spotlight>”terminal___” <br>
Run this command in the terminal ___cd ~/path/to/directory___ <br>
For example, if you downloaded the file on your desktop in a subfolder called scripts, the command would look like this <br> 
___cd ~/Desktop/scripts___ <br>
After, run this command in the terminal ___chmod +x comp_info.sh___ <br>
To run the script, enter ___bash comp_info.sh___ in the terminal <br>

If you want the output to be a text file <br>
Enter ___./comp_info.sh > output.txt___ in your terminal, and it will make a text file in the same folder the comp_info file is in.
